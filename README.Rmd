gtable is a layout engine build on top of the grid package. It is used to 
abstract away the creation of (potentially nested) grids of viewports into which
graphic objects can be placed. The use of gtable makes it easy to ensure 
alignment of graphic elements as well as building up complex graphic 
compositions in a piecemeal fashion. gtable is the layout engine powering 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) and is thus used extensively by many
plotting functions in R without being called directly.

## Installation

You can install the released version of gtable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("gtable")
```

or use the remotes package to install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/r-lib/gtable)

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/gtable")
```

## Example
As described above, ggplot2 uses gtable for laying out the plot, and it is
possible to access the gtable representation of a plot for inspection and 
modification:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gtable)
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + geom_point()

p_table <- ggplotGrob(p)

p_table
```

As can be seen, a gtable object is a collection of graphic elements along with
their placement in the grid and the dimensions of the grid itself. graphic 
elements can span multiple rows and columns in the grid and be gtables 
themselves allowing for very complex automatically arranging layouts.

A gtable object is itself a grob, and can thus be drawn using standard functions
from the grid package:

```{r}
library(grid)
grid.draw(p_table) # alternative use plot(p_table)
```

While most people will interact with gtable through ggplot2, it is certainly 
possible to use it to build a plot up from the ground.

```{r}
# Construct some graphical elements using grid
points <- pointsGrob(
  x = runif(10),
  y = runif(10),
  size = unit(runif(10), 'cm')
)
xaxis <- xaxisGrob(at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
yaxis <- yaxisGrob(at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))

# Setup the gtable layout
plot <- gtable(
  widths = unit(c(1.5, 0, 1, 0.5), c('cm', 'cm', 'null', 'cm')),
  heights = unit(c(0.5, 1, 0, 1), c('cm', 'null', 'cm', 'cm'))
)

# Add the grobs
plot <- gtable_add_grob(
  plot,
  grobs = list(points, xaxis, yaxis),
  t = c(2, 3, 2),
  l = c(3, 3, 2),
  clip = 'off'
)

# Plot
grid.draw(plot)
```
