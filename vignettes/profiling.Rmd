```

The performance of `gtable` is critical as it has the potential to slow down
plot creation a lot. In order to continuously monitor the performance of gtable
the following piece of code is used to 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1))

p_build <- ggplot_build(p)


```
